# Shopping Cart App with React and Redux

This repository contains the course source code and other extra materials like slides.

## How to use

### Downloading code snapshots

You can download all the content of a branch via the "Code" button here on Github. You can then either [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository or simply download the selected branch content as a ZIP file.

**Important:** You always download the **main branch content!**

You can then dive into the interesting folders (e.g. the individual code snapshots) locally on your hard drive.

### Running the attached code

You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it.

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the `cd` command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run `npm install` to install all required dependencies (this will create a `/node_modules` folder).

Once installed the node_modules then you need to run the code using `npm run`.
